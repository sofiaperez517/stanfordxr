<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Our AR game is designed to help users reconnect with their cultural roots and learn new languages through interactive, culturally immersive experiences. Players engage in real-world scenarios, interacting with virtual mentors who guide them through language lessons based on real-life tasks, traditions, and customs.

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Conversational Language Learning:<h3></h3> Practice language skills in real-life, immersive scenarios.

<h3>Augmented Reality (AR):<h3></h3> Game characters and tasks appear in the player’s physical environment.

<h3>Personalized Mentors:<h3></h3> Virtual mentors guide players through culturally rich experiences.

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
Our project is powered by the following technologies:
- ChatGPT-4: Natural language processing to create responsive and conversational mentors.
- Unity: Core game development and AR integration.
- Blender: 3D modeling and animation for creating realistic characters and environments.
- Jupyter Notebook: Data processing, analysis, and experimentation.
